"""Shared scorer library. All scorers return the standard inspect-ai
``Score`` shape so the rollup layer stays scorer-agnostic.

Scorers are split into two tiers:

- ``__all__`` — production-ready, used in at least one reference eval,
  exercised in tests, safe for mentees to copy-paste.
- ``EXPERIMENTAL`` — implementations that compile and have a clear
  contract but aren't currently wired into any eval and have no test
  coverage. Importing them works (``from p3.scorers import
  consistency_across_paraphrases``) but a PR that uses one should
  include both an eval that exercises it and tests for the new path.
